PROJECT IN ADVANCED ALGEBRA

This project has been done as end work for the course "Advanced Algebra" in Bar-Ilan University.
2023, first semester.

The aim of this project is to implement finite fields of cardinality $`p^n`$ for any natural number $`n`$. Let $`l`$ be and $`n`$-dimensional field extension of $`k`$ by an irreducible polynomial $`f(x) \in k[x]`$ of degree $`n`$.

We have that $`l \cong k[x]/\langle f(x)\rangle`$
